# HW4-Code-Quiz

This homework is an example of Javascript fundamentals. I've created a quiz that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 

When you click the start button a timer starts and and you are presented with the quiz.

When you answer a question then you are presented with another question. When you answer a question incorrectly the time is subtracted from the clock.

When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. At this point you save your initials and score.
